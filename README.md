# cricket-project

This project is an empirical study of T20 cricket since its inception in the early 2000s, with a focus on India's top 4 batsmen. With two T20 world cups in 2021 and 2022, I use past performances to predict future performance of India's opening batsman and what the ideal opening combination might be.
